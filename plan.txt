1. Plan & Design
The first step is to plan and design my new room. Decide what color of the walls I want, how the new floor should look like or what furniture will play together nicely. This is the time to think about the whole functionality of the room and also to decide what is going to stay and what I need to buy.
2. Electrical Installation
Here I need to think about the future lighting and where do I need additional electrical outlets. It would also be useful to check the whole state of the existing installation.
3. The Floor
When everything is designed and new outlets are created, I can tear off the old floor, level the ground and lay new and shiny floor panels.
4. The Walls
The floor is safe and sound, I can now smooth all the walls and after that they will be ready for new paint.
5. Furniture
The base of the room is ready, so looking at the initial design I can go to IKEA and buy new furniture. All I need to do now is to assemble everything.

And thatâ€™s it, my new room will be great!
